₊˚🖇️✩ OVERVIEW‧ ₊˚📖

Sleep Tight, Book Right is a console-based Java application that serves
as a hotel room reservation and booking management system. The program
allows users to select floors, choose available rooms, and schedule
their bookings based on the day of the week.

The system enables tourists or customers to reserve a specific room
by inputting the preferred floor, room number, and weekday. The
application automatically checks for conflicts to ensure that no
duplicate bookings are made for the same room on the same day. Each
successful reservation displays a complete summary including the
tourist’s name, room details, booking day, and total fee.

An administrative panel is also included, allowing the admin to:

1. View all confirmed bookings.
2. Cancel existing reservations.
3. Monitor room availability across all floors.

This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, method overriding,
and modular class structure. It also utilizes ArrayLists for storing
bookings and ensures a clear, organized data flow in a terminal-based
environment.

Sleep Tight, Book Right aims to simulate a simple yet fully functional
hotel booking system suitable for learning and practicing OOP concepts
in Java.

🧩OOP Concepts Applied (Sleep Tight, Book Right)

🔒Encapsulation *ੈ✩‧₊˚

In *Sleep Tight, Book Right*, encapsulation is shown by keeping hotel-related data private inside classes such as `Hotel`, `Room`, and `Booking`. Important information like room rates, floor numbers, tourist names, and booking schedules is protected using private fields. These values cannot be modified directly from outside the class. Instead, the system uses getters and controlled methods to access and update the data. This prevents accidental changes to room rates or bookings and ensures that only valid, authorized operations can affect the hotel records.


🧬Inheritance✧₊⁺.˚୨ৎ

The system demonstrates inheritance through the relationship between `Hotel` and `Room`. The `Room` class extends the `Hotel` class, allowing it to inherit properties such as the hotel name and floor rates. This means all rooms automatically gain access to hotel information without rewriting the same code. The subclass (`Room`) can also add its own specific attributes, such as floor number, room number, and the corresponding room rate. This reduces redundancy and promotes cleaner code.

 🎭Polymorphism✩⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧

Polymorphism appears in the system through overridden and reusable methods. For example, the `showBookingSummary()` method displays booking details based on the specific booking object calling it. The system also shows different outputs for room availability depending on whether a room is already reserved or still open for booking. The program uses a `switch` expression to convert weekday numbers into weekday names, allowing the same method to produce different results depending on the input.


 🧱 Abstraction₊˚⊹ᰔ

Abstraction is applied by hiding complex booking validation and room-checking processes inside simple methods. The system internally handles tasks such as detecting duplicate bookings, scanning for available rooms, and validating floor or room selections. Instead of writing the logic repeatedly in the main program, methods like `isDuplicate()` and room-availability loops perform the detailed work behind the scenes. This keeps the menu system and user interface clean while the essential logic remains neatly organized inside the appropriate classes.
